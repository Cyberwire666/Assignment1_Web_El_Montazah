    <li><h3>19th Century:</h3></li>
    <p>
        El Montazah traces its origins back to the late 19th century during the rule of Khedive Abbas II, who envisioned creating a royal retreat along the Mediterranean coast of Egypt. <br>
         Construction of the palace complex began in 1892, with Khedive Abbas II overseeing the development of the sprawling gardens and palatial structures.

        El Montazah became a favored summer residence for the Egyptian royal family, serving as a luxurious retreat away from the hustle and bustle of Cairo. <br>
         Under the reign of King Fuad I and later King Farouk, El Montazah flourished as a center of royal leisure and entertainment. <br>
          It hosted numerous dignitaries, diplomats, and celebrities, further enhancing its prestige. <br>

        Following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, which led to the overthrow of the monarchy, El Montazah underwent a period of transition. <br>
         The property came under state ownership and was opened to the public. <br>
          While the royal family no longer resided at El Montazah, it continued to attract visitors who marveled at its architectural splendor and picturesque gardens.
